## Contribute

We are also looking for enthusiastic web developer who wants to join the team!  
  
The Team right now consists of two people [me](https://github.com/slatyo) and [Marc](https://github.com/marcreichel).  
Both of us are professional web developers.
We are working together now for a long time and also working on multiple free time projects.  
  
**Any of those key-features you need to contribute**  
*PHP 7+*  
We are using Laravel to develop the dashboard and the bot.  
  
*MySQL*  
The standard - we are using MariaDB.  
  
*JavaScript*  
For now we are using jQuery as the framework behind JavaScript. 
For the near future we want to use Angular.  
  
*Frontend*  
SCSS and Bootstrap so far 
  
*Restful APIs*  
Right now we are using the twitch api only (v5) - but we are about to create our own API  
as soon as possible because there are more projects  
  
and more things like comopser, npm and so on.  
  
We are not looking for someone who can handle anything by himself. Everyone can have his key feature  
and be part of the team.  
You don't have to be a full stack developer and also you don't need to have any uptime - its still  
a freetime project!  
  
**Git Process**  
Our way from the idea to the implementation is restricted by a few things.  
  
First of all:  
Having ideas is great - but also we don't want to have like "every" feature implementet in our  
Moderation Bot. Therefore we created a work-around where each idea can be presented and gets discussed  
by the whole team.  
If the idea gets accepted / approved by the team we then create a project (GitHub as some amazing ways   
to handle things like this) and milestones - literally using GitHub at its fullest.  
So we always have track to what is happening right now - what is missing - what is in work so different  
team members can join the project.  
  
Thats like a small insight to how we work - of course there is more but this always comes step by step.  
Don't worry!  
  
If you want more information to how we handle the project you can always ask me!  
You can find me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/slatyoo) or find us at our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XuHNPkC)!
